            <p>No longer untitled - I'm calling the WIP game &quot;Barrow&quot;, which I suppose is Tolkien-inspired, but also generally evocative of the experience of exploring a dark and ancient stone tomb.</p>
<p>Try it:</p>
<p><canvas id="canvas" width="800" height="600"></canvas></p>
<script src="./wasm/barrow_v3.js"></script>
<script>
    window.addEventListener("load", async () => {
    await wasm_bindgen("./wasm/barrow_v3_bg.wasm");
    });
</script>
<p>What is it about?  Barrow is a roguelike with a traditional lineage, focused on an old-school dungeon crawl, and an emphasis on tactical combat.  Barrow allows bump-to-attack gameplay, but it will punish you for it - you can win a fight against the weakest enemies, goblins, by mindlessly attacking, but the stronger enemies demand use of five more advanced combat strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>power attacks to deplete the opponents health and stamina faster</li>
<li>swapping stances to keep your guard up and deflect more damage</li>
<li>waiting for the opponent to deplete their stamina, and conserving your own</li>
<li>breaking the opponent's guard by depleting their stamina to 0</li>
<li>taking advantage of the opponents broken guard to rapidly finish them off</li>
</ul>
<p>As it stands right now, all of these mechanisms are implemented and working, and the game is playable, but it needs more balancing; it also needs a lot of UI love to make these mechanisms visible and intuitive, which is the biggest gap right now.  I did a first pass to make the monster AI a little more dynamic, but there's a lot more to be done on that front as well.</p>
<p>What I'm proudest of right now is the graphics, and especially the lighting/visiblity rendering - I made a flickering light effect using RLTK's lovely noise module - I think this is simplex noise, not perlin noise, but it's pretty either way:</p>

<p>This was also the first time I've really hit a roadblock because of Rust's borrow checker.  As part of implementing the new game logic, I merged Wolverson's <code>MeleeCombatSystem</code> and <code>DamageSystem</code> into a single <code>ActionSystem</code> that would apply all the combat rules in a single pass; but what I found is that Rust's borrow checker wouldn't permit me to borrow mutable references to two items in the same vector; in particular, if I need to borrow both the players stats struct as well as the target monsters stats from the same <code>CombatStats</code> Storage (which is an abstraction over a sparse vector, hashmap, etc.) then I end up having two mutable borrows of the storage object itself.</p>
<p>The workaround wasn't that bad, just unintuitive - I had to do the borrows separately in bare blocks so they aren't in the same scope:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span>                        log.entries.</span><span style="color:#96b5b4;">push</span><span>(format!(&quot;</span><span style="color:#d08770;">{}</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;"> hits #[orange]</span><span style="color:#d08770;">{}</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">#[] fiercely for #[orange]</span><span style="color:#d08770;">{}</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;"> hp#[].</span><span>&quot;, &amp;name.name, &amp;target_name.name, raw_damage));
</span><span>                        {
</span><span>                            </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">let</span><span> subject_stats = combat_stats.</span><span style="color:#96b5b4;">get_mut</span><span>(entity).</span><span style="color:#96b5b4;">unwrap</span><span>();
</span><span>                            </span><span style="color:#96b5b4;">apply_ep_damage</span><span>(subject_stats,ep_cost);
</span><span>                        }
</span><span>                        {
</span><span>                            </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">let</span><span> target_stats = combat_stats.</span><span style="color:#96b5b4;">get_mut</span><span>(*target).</span><span style="color:#96b5b4;">unwrap</span><span>();
</span><span>                            </span><span style="color:#96b5b4;">apply_hp_damage</span><span>(target_stats, raw_damage);
</span><span>                            </span><span style="color:#96b5b4;">apply_ep_damage</span><span>(target_stats, ep_damage);
</span><span>                        }
</span></code></pre>
<p>I'm still on the fence about Rust conceptually - it's just not 100% clear to me how much Rust's borrow checker is actually intrusive, and how many legitimate design patterns it gets in the way of.  <a href="https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/index.html">Doubly linked lists</a> are the classic example, and maybe I am starting to understand Rust well enough to read through that book.</p>
<p>Anyhow - the other big thing missing from Barrow right now is audio, which I don't think RLTK supports at all - that might entail porting it to Bevy or another framework, we'll see, but in the meantime I might want to change it up and work on a few audio projects.</p>
