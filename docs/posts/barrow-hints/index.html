            <p>Basic Instructions</p>
<ul>
<li>Every character and action has a tooltip - hover the mouse over the right-hand side for detailed info</li>
<li>Tooltips for monsters often contain helpful strategies</li>
<li>traditional bump-to-attack will work, but you can also use the J/K/L keys for special attacks</li>
<li>likewise, X/Space allow you to skip a turn, N lets you perform Fend in Ready stance, M lets you Block in Guard stance</li>
<li>every monster in view has a target number - press the number on your keyboard to target that monster</li>
<li>Every creature in Barrow has EP, or Stamina, that is used for special attacks such as Smash or Bash</li>
<li>The player character also has stances, that change depending on the last attack used</li>
<li>Monsters have stances as well, but they are static</li>
<li>The three stances are Ready, Guard, and Power</li>
<li>Different stances and attacks have strengths and weaknesses against each other</li>
<li>There are three offensive actions: Melee, Smash, and Bash</li>
<li>There are three defensive actions: Wait, Fend, and Block</li>
<li>Not every move is available in every stance</li>
<li>You can recover HP by Waiting outside of combat - but waiting consumes your food supplies</li>
<li>If you return to town, you can buy more food or equipment upgrades</li>
<li>Make sure to upgrade your equipment, enemies become stronger as you descend</li>
<li>Buying a pack upgrade will let you store more food</li>
<li>A long rest in town will respawn all enemies and treasure in the dungeon, and reset layouts</li>
</ul>
<p>Advanced Hints</p>
<ul>
<li>Your basic melee attack costs no stamina!</li>
<li>If you are Stunned, use the wait or movement keys to recover stamina</li>
<li>Wait recovers EP, and cannot be interrupted</li>
<li>Fend is strong against Smash</li>
<li>Block is strong against Melee attacks</li>
<li>Bash is costly, but very effective against Block</li>
<li>Stamina can also be depleted by an opponent's attacks</li>
<li>If your stamina is reduced below zero, you are stunned, and must recover</li>
<li>Exploiting Stun is a highly effective tactic against defensive enemies</li>
<li>Enemies' behavior varies dynamically based on their stamina</li>
<li>When an enemy has low stamina, they are more likely to wait and recover</li>
<li>If you hold shift and press comma to ascend, you will return to town immediately</li>
<li>You can descend to the deepest level reached from town, even after a long rest</li>
</ul>
<p>Spoiler-level Tips</p>
<ul>
<li>To defeat the hobgobling and goblin knight, use Bash to stun-lock them</li>
<li>To defeat the orc or troll, use fend until they exhaust themselves, then melee them</li>
<li>To defeat the final boss, use fend until his stamina is below 30, then melee</li>
<li>There is a cheat mode hidden on the main menu, just scroll down</li>
<li>Cheat mode starts you with enough coins to buy every upgrade, and lets you descend to level 4 immediately</li>
</ul>
