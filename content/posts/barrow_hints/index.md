Basic Instructions
- Every character and action has a tooltip - hover the mouse over the right-hand side for detailed info
- Tooltips for monsters often contain helpful strategies
- traditional bump-to-attack will work, but you can also use the J/K/L keys for special attacks
- likewise, X/Space allow you to skip a turn, N lets you perform Fend in Ready stance, M lets you Block in Guard stance
- every monster in view has a target number - press the number on your keyboard to target that monster
- Every creature in Barrow has EP, or Stamina, that is used for special attacks such as Smash or Bash
- The player character also has stances, that change depending on the last attack used
- Monsters have stances as well, but they are static
- The three stances are Ready, Guard, and Power
- Different stances and attacks have strengths and weaknesses against each other
- There are three offensive actions: Melee, Smash, and Bash
- There are three defensive actions: Wait, Fend, and Block
- Not every move is available in every stance
- You can recover HP by Waiting outside of combat - but waiting consumes your food supplies
- If you return to town, you can buy more food or equipment upgrades
- Make sure to upgrade your equipment, enemies become stronger as you descend
- Buying a pack upgrade will let you store more food
- A long rest in town will respawn all enemies and treasure in the dungeon, and reset layouts

Advanced Hints
- Your basic melee attack costs no stamina!
- If you are Stunned, use the wait or movement keys to recover stamina
- Wait recovers EP, and cannot be interrupted
- Fend is strong against Smash
- Block is strong against Melee attacks
- Bash is costly, but very effective against Block
- Stamina can also be depleted by an opponent's attacks
- If your stamina is reduced below zero, you are stunned, and must recover
- Exploiting Stun is a highly effective tactic against defensive enemies
- Enemies' behavior varies dynamically based on their stamina
- Every enemy has a hidden stamina threshold, and will recover when they are below that threshold.  Some enemies are conservative, others will burst you down as fast as they can.
- When an enemy has low stamina, they are more likely to wait and recover
- You can descend to the deepest level reached from town, even after a long rest

Spoiler-level Tips
- To defeat the hobgobling and goblin knight, use Bash to stun-lock them
- To defeat orcs, try using Smash attacks to deplete their stamina
- To defeat the troll, use fend until it is exhausted, then melee
- To defeat the final boss, use fend until his stamina is below 30, then melee
- There is a cheat mode hidden on the main menu, just scroll down
- Cheat mode starts you with enough coins to buy every upgrade, and lets you descend to level 4 immediately
