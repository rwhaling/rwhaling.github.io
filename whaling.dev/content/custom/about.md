Hi - my name's Richard Whaling. I grew up in Houston, Texas, I live in Chicago, Illinois.  I'm an engineer, writer, and musician, probably in that order. 

I wrote a book, ["Modern Systems Programming with Scala Native"](https://pragprog.com/titles/rwscala/modern-systems-programming-with-scala-native/), available from PragProg: 

I also made ["Entropy"](https://rustedtonerecordings.bandcamp.com/album/entropy), a cassette tape of generative modular synthesizer recordings: 

Technically speaking - my original passion is concurrent systems programming and database guts, but I've drifted into distributed systems and data for the most part.  

And to be entirely transparent - I'm at the stage of my career where I could drift away from my technical passions, and become a pure bureaucrat - part of what drove me to set up this post is the recognition that I don't want that, and that side-projects like these are the best way for me to hone my technical edge.
